This project aims to create a simple book library with 3 different shelves

- Read
  The books are located on Udacity's Database which we fetch the books data from using their public API.
  You can freely add books from their library to your own.

## Installing

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

and that's it, you are good to go.

### Usage

Once you run the project, you can add new books by navigating to `/search` Or by pressing on the `+` button on the bottom right.
You can search for the book you need by typing anything related to it on the live search bar which will excute the results while you are typing.
Then you can add books to your own library from the search results by pressing on it and choose which shelf u want to add it to.

Note: The existing books, if it appeared in the results, u will be able to change its shelf too, and it will display in which shelf it already is.
